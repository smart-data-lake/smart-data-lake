/**
 * Spark streaming execution mode uses Spark Structured Streaming to incrementally execute data loads and keep track of processed data.
 * This mode needs a DataObject implementing CanCreateStreamingDataFrame and works only with SparkSubFeeds.
 * This mode can be executed synchronously in the DAG by using triggerType=Once, or asynchronously as Streaming Query with triggerType = ProcessingTime or Continuous.
 *
 * @param checkpointLocation location for checkpoints of streaming query to keep state
 * @param triggerType        define execution interval of Spark streaming query. Possible values are Once (default), ProcessingTime & Continuous. See [[Trigger]] for details.
 *                           Note that this is only applied if SDL is executed in streaming mode. If SDL is executed in normal mode, TriggerType=Once is used always.
 *                           If triggerType=Once, the action is repeated with Trigger.Once in SDL streaming mode.
 * @param triggerTime        Time as String in triggerType = ProcessingTime or Continuous. See [[Trigger]] for details.
 * @param inputOptions       additional option to apply when reading streaming source. This overwrites options set by the DataObjects.
 * @param outputOptions      additional option to apply when writing to streaming sink. This overwrites options set by the DataObjects.
