  /**
   * Compacting hadoop partitions is not supported out-of-the-box by hadoop, as files need to be read with the correct format and written again.
   * The following steps are used to compact partitions with Spark:
   * 1. Check if compaction is already in progress by looking for a special file "_SDL_COMPACTING" in data objects root hadoop path. If it exists
   *    and is not older than 12h exit compaction with Exception. Otherwise create/update special file "_COMPACTION". If the file is older than 12h
   *    the compaction process is assumed to be crashed.
   * 2. As step 5 is not atomic (delete and move are two operations), we need to check for possibly incomplete compactions of previous crashed runs and fix them.
   *    Incomplete compactions are marked with a special file "_SDL_MOVING" in the temporary path.
   *    Incomplete compacted partitions must be moved from temporary path to hadoop path (see step 5)
   *    and marked as compacted (see step 6).
   * 3. Filter already compacted partitions from given partitions by looking for "_SDL_COMPACTED" file, see step 5
   * 4. Data from partitions to be compacted is rewritten into a temporary path under this data objects hadoop path.
   * 5. Partitions to be compacted are deleted from the hadoop path and moved from the temporary path to the hadoop path. This should be done one-by-one to reduce risk of data loss.
   *    To recover in case of unexpected abort between delete and move, a special file "_SDL_MOVING" is created in temporary path before deleting hadoop path.
   *    After moving the temporary path, this file is deleted again. Mark compacted partitions by creating a special file "_SDL_COMPACTED" and
   * 6.  Delete "_SDL_COMPACTING" file created in step 1.
   * @param dataObject: DataObject with partition values to compact. The DataObject must be partitioned, able to read & write DataFrames and have a hadoop standard partition layout.
   * @param partitionValues: partition values to compact
