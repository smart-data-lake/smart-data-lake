 * Configuration for the Server that provides live status info of the current DAG Execution

 * @param port           : port with which the first connection attempt is made
 * @param maxPortRetries : If port is already in use, we will increment port by one and try with that new port.
 *                       maxPortRetries describes how many times this should be attempted. If set to 0 it will not be attempted.
 *                       Values below 0 are not allowed.
 * @param stopOnEnd      : Set to false if the Server should remain online even after SDL has finished its execution.
 *                       In that case, the Application needs to be stopped manually. Useful for debugging.
