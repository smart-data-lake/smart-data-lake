## Requirements

To run this tutorial you just need two things:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started), including docker-compose. If you use Windows, you might want to use [podman as an alternative to docker](troubleshooting/docker-on-windows.md).
- The [source code of the example](https://github.com/smart-data-lake/getting-started).

## Build Spark docker image

- Download the source code of the example either via git or by [downloading the zip](https://github.com/smart-data-lake/getting-started/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extracting it.
- Open up a terminal and change to the folder with the source, you should see a file called Dockerfile. 
- Then run (note: this might take some time, but it's only needed once):

<Tabs groupId = "docker-podman-switch"
defaultValue="docker"
values={[
{label: 'Docker', value: 'docker'},
{label: 'Podman', value: 'podman'},
]}>
<TabItem value="docker">

```jsx
docker build -t sdl-spark .
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="podman">

```jsx
podman build -v ${PWD}/.mvnrepo:/mnt/.mvnrepo -t sdl-spark .
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Compile Scala Classes

Utilizing a Maven container, the getting-started project with the required SDL Scala sources and all required libraries are compiled and packed using the following command.  

<Tabs groupId = "docker-podman-switch"
defaultValue="docker"
values={[
{label: 'Docker', value: 'docker'},
{label: 'Podman', value: 'podman'},
]}>
<TabItem value="docker">

```jsx
mkdir .mvnrepo
docker run -v ${PWD}:/mnt/project -v ${PWD}/.mvnrepo:/mnt/.mvnrepo maven:3.6.0-jdk-11-slim -- mvn -f /mnt/project/pom.xml "-Dmaven.repo.local=/mnt/.mvnrepo" package
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="podman">

```jsx
mkdir .mvnrepo
podman run -v ${PWD}:/mnt/project -v ${PWD}/.mvnrepo:/mnt/.mvnrepo maven:3.6.0-jdk-11-slim -- mvn -f /mnt/project/pom.xml "-Dmaven.repo.local=/mnt/.mvnrepo" package
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
This might take some time, but it's only needed at the beginning or if Scala code has changed.

## Run SDL with Spark docker image


Now let's see Smart Data Lake in action!

<Tabs groupId = "docker-podman-switch"
defaultValue="docker"
values={[
{label: 'Docker', value: 'docker'},
{label: 'Podman', value: 'podman'},
]}>
<TabItem value="docker">

```jsx
mkdir data
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/data:/mnt/data -v ${PWD}/target:/mnt/lib -v ${PWD}/config:/mnt/config sdl-spark:latest --config /mnt/config --feed-sel download
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="podman">

```jsx
mkdir data
podman run --rm -v ${PWD}/data:/mnt/data -v ${PWD}/target:/mnt/lib -v ${PWD}/config:/mnt/config sdl-spark:latest --config /mnt/config --feed-sel download
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This creates a folder in the current directory named *data* and then 
executes a simple data pipeline that downloads two files from two different websites into that directory.

When the execution is complete, you should see the two files in the *data* folder.
Wonder what happened ? You will create the data pipeline that does just this in the first steps of this guide.

If you wish, you can start with [part 1](get-input-data) right away.
For [part 2](part-2/industrializing.md) and [part 3](part-3/custom-webservice.md), it is recommended to setup a Development Environment.

## Development Environment
For some parts of this tutorial it is beneficial to have a working development environment ready. In the following we will mainly explain how one can configure a working evironment for 
Windows or Linux. We will focus on the community version of Intellij. Please [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) the version that suits your operating system. 
### Hadoop Setup (Needed for Windows only)
Windows Users need to follow the steps below to have a working Hadoop Installation :
1. First download the Windows binaries for Hadoop [here](https://github.com/cdarlint/winutils/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Extract the wished version to a folder (e.g. &lt prefix &gt\hadoop-&lt version &gt\bin ). For this tutorial we use the version 3.2.2.
3. Configure the *HADOOP_HOME* environment variable to point to the folder &lt prefix &gt\hadoop-&lt version &gt\
4. Add the *%HADOOP_HOME%\bin* to the *PATH* environment variable

### Run SDL in IntelliJ
We will focus on the community version of Intellij. Please [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) the version that suits your operating system.
This needs an Intellij and Java SDK installation. Please make sure you have:
- Java 8 SDK or Java 11 SDK
- Scala Version 2.12. You need to install the Scala-Plugin with this exact version and DO NOT UPGRADE to Scala 3. For the complete list of versions at play in SDLB, [you can consult the Reference](../reference/build).

1. Load the project as a maven project: Right-click on pom.xml file -> add as Maven Project
2. Ensure all correct dependencies are loaded: Right-click on pom.xml file, Maven -> Reload Project
3. Configure and run the following run configuration in IntelliJ IDEA:
    - Main class: `io.smartdatalake.app.LocalSmartDataLakeBuilder`
    - Program arguments: `--feed-sel <regex-feedname-selector> --config $ProjectFileDir$/config`
    - Working directory: `/path/to/sdl-examples/target` or just `target`

**Congratulations!** You're now all setup! Head over to the next step to analyse these files...
