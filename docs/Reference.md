# Reference
After running your first [examples](GettingStarted.md) this page will give you more details on all available options and the core concepts behind Smart Data Lake.

## Configuration - HOCON
The configuration files are stored in the [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) file format.
The main sections are global, connections, data objects and actions. 
As a starting point, use the [application.conf](https://github.com/smart-data-lake/sdl-examples/blob/develop/src/main/resources/application.conf) from SDL-examples. 
More details and options are described below. 

### Global Options
In the global section of the configuration you can set global configurations such as spark options used by all executions.
You can find a list of all configurations under [API docs](site/scaladocs/io/smartdatalake/app/GlobalConfig.html).  
A good list with examples can be found in the [application.conf](https://github.com/smart-data-lake/sdl-examples/blob/develop/src/main/resources/application.conf) of sdl-examples.

### Secrets User and Password Variables
Usernames, passwords and other secrets should not be stored in your configuration files in clear text as these files are often stored directly in the version control system.
They should also not be visible in logfiles after execution.

Instead of having the username and password configured directly in your configuration files, you can use secret providers
for configuration values that end with `...Variable`, like BasicAuthMode's userVariable and passwordVariable.
To configure a secret use the convention `<SecretProviderId>#<SecretName>`.

Default secret providers are:

SecretProviderId|Pattern|Meaning
---|---|---
CLEAR|CLEAR#pd|The secret will be used literally (cleartext). This is only recommended for test environments.
ENV|ENV#pd|The value for this secret will be read from the environment variable called "pd". 

You can configure custom secret providers by providing a list of secret providers with custom options and their id in GlobalConfig as follows:
```
global {
  secretProviders {
    <secretProviderId> = {
     className = <fully qualified class name of SecretProvider>
     options = { <options as key/value> }
    }
  }
}
```

Example: configure DatabricksSecretProvider with id=DBSECRETS and scope=test (scope is a specific configuration needed for accessing secrets in Databricks).
```
global {
  secretProviders {
    DBSECRETS = {
     className = io.smartdatalake.util.secrets.DatabricksSecretProvider
     options = { scope = test }
    }
  }
}
```

You can create custom SecretProvider classes by implementing trait SecretProvider and a constructor with parameter `options: Map[String,String]`.

### Local substitution
Local substitution allows to reuse the id of a configuration object inside its attribute definitions by the special token "~{id}". See the following example:
```
dataObjects {
  dataXY {
    type = HiveTableDataObject
    path = "/data/~{id}"
    table {
      db = "default"
      name = "~{id}"
    }
  }
}
```
Note: local substitution only works in a fixed set of attributes defined in Environment.configPathsForLocalSubstitution.

## Connections
Some Data Objects need a connection, e.g. JdbcTableDataObject, as they need to know how to connect to a database.
Instead of defining the connection information for every data object, you can conveniently define it in one place and just use the reference in the data objects.
The possible parameters depend on the connection type. Please note the section on [usernames and password](#user-and-password-variables).

For a list of all available connections, please consult the [API docs](site/scaladocs/io/smartdatalake/workflow/connection/package.html) directly.

In the package overview, you can also see the parameters available to each type of connection and which parameters are optional.

## Data Objects
For a list of all available data objects, please consult the [API docs](site/scaladocs/io/smartdatalake/workflow/dataobject/package.html) directly.
In the package overview, you can also see the parameters available to each type of data object and which parameters are optional.

Data objects are structured in a hierarchy as many attributes are shared between them, i.e. do Hive tables and transactional tables share common attributes modeled in TableDataObject. 

Here is an overview of all data objects:
![data object hierarchy](images/dataobject_hierarchy.png)

## Actions
For a list of all available actions, please consult the [API docs](site/scaladocs/io/smartdatalake/workflow/action/package.html) directly.

In the package overview, you can also see the parameters available to each type of action and which parameters are optional.


# Command Line
SmartDataLakeBuilder is a java application. To run on a cluster with spark-submit use **DefaultSmartDataLakeBuilder** application.
It can be started with the following command line (details see [YARN](YARN.md))
```bash
spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode client --class io.smartdatalake.app.DefaultSmartDataLakeBuilder target/smartdatalake_2.11-1.0.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar [arguments]
```
and takes the following arguments:
```
Usage: DefaultSmartDataLakeBuilder [options]

# Concepts

## DAG

### Execution phases - early validation
Execution of a SmartDataLakeBuilder run is designed with "early validation" in mind. This means it tries to fail as early as possible if something is wrong. 
Execution therefore involves the following phases.
1. Parse configuration: configuration is parsed and validated 
2. DAG prepare: Preconditions are validated. This includes testing Connections and DataObject structures which must exists. 
3. DAG init: Lineage of Actions according to the DAG is created and validated. For Spark Actions this involves the validation of the DataFrame lineage. A column which doesn't exist but is referenced in a later Action will fail the execution.    
4. DAG exec: Execution of Actions, data is effectively (and only) transferred during this phase.

## Streaming
You can execute any DAG in streaming mode by using commandline option `--streaming`.
In streaming mode SDL executes the Exec-phase of the same DAG continuously, processing your data incrementally. 
SDL discerns between synchronous and asynchronous actions:
- Synchronous actions are executed one after another in the DAG, they are synchronized with their predecessors and successors.
- Asynchronous actions have their own rhythm. They are executed not synchronized from the other actions, except for the first increment. In the first increment their start is synchronized with their predecessors and the first execution is waited for before starting their successors. This allows to maintain execution order for initial loads, where tables and directories might need to be created one after another.

You can mix synchronous and asynchronous actions in the same DAG. Asynchronous actions are started in the first increment. Synchronous actions are executed in each execution of the DAG.

Whether an action is synchronous or asynchronous depends on the execution engine used. For now only "Spark Structured Streaming" is an asynchronous execution engine. It is configured by setting execution mode SparkStreamingMode to an action. 

You can control the minimum delay between synchronous streaming runs by setting configuration `global.synchronousStreamingTriggerIntervalSec` to a certain amount of seconds.
For asynchronous streaming actions this is controlled by the corresponding streaming mode, e.g. SparkStreamingMode.

## Execution modes
Execution modes select the data to be processed. By default, if you start SmartDataLakeBuilder, there is no filter applied. This means every Action reads all data from its input DataObjects.

You can set an execution mode by defining attribute "executionMode" of an Action. Define the chosen ExecutionMode by setting type as follows:
```
executionMode {
  type = PartitionDiffMode
  attribute1 = ...
}
```

### Fixed partition values filter
You can apply a filter manually by specifying parameter --partition-values or --multi-partition-values on the command line. The partition values specified are passed to all start-Actions of a DAG and filtered for every input DataObject by its defined partition columns.
On execution every Action takes the partition values of the input and filters them again for every output DataObject by its defined partition columns, which serve again as partition values for the input of the next Action. 
Note that during execution of the dag, no new partition values are added, they are only filtered. An exception is if you place a PartitionDiffMode in the middle of your pipeline, see next section.

### PartitionDiffMode: Dynamic partition values filter 
Alternatively you can let SmartDataLakeBuilder find missing partitions and set partition values automatically by specifying execution mode PartitionDiffMode.

By defining the **applyCondition** attribute you can give a condition to decide at runtime if the PartitionDiffMode should be applied or not.
Default is to apply the PartitionDiffMode if the given partition values are empty (partition values from command line or passed from previous action). 
Define an applyCondition by a spark sql expression working with attributes of DefaultExecutionModeExpressionData returning a boolean.

By defining the **failCondition** attribute you can give a condition to fail application of execution mode if true. 
It can be used to fail a run based on expected partitions, time and so on.
The expression is evaluated after execution of PartitionDiffMode, amongst others there are attributes inputPartitionValues, outputPartitionValues and selectedPartitionValues to make the decision.
Default is that the application of the PartitionDiffMode does not fail the action. If there is no data to process, the following actions are skipped.
Define a failCondition by a spark sql expression working with attributes of PartitionDiffModeExpressionData returning a boolean.

Example - fail if partitions are not processed in strictly increasing order of partition column "dt":
```
  failCondition = "(size(selectedPartitionValues) > 0 and array_min(transform(selectedPartitionValues, x -> x.dt)) < array_max(transform(outputPartitionValues, x -> x.dt)))"
```

Sometimes the failCondition can become quite complex with multiple terms concatenated by or-logic. 
To improve interpretabily of error messages, multiple fail conditions can be configured as array with attribute **failConditions**. For every condition you can also define a description which will be inserted into the error message. 

Finally By defining **selectExpression** you can customize which partitions are selected.
Define a spark sql expression working with attributes of PartitionDiffModeExpressionData returning a Seq(Map(String,String)).

Example - only process the last selected partition: 
```
  selectExpression = "slice(selectedPartitionValues,-1,1)"
```

By defining **alternativeOutputId** attribute you can define another DataObject which will be used to check for already existing data.
This can be used to select data to process against a DataObject later in the pipeline.

### SparkStreamingMode: Incremental load 
Some DataObjects are not partitioned, but nevertheless you dont want to read all data from the input on every run. You want to load it incrementally.
This can be accomplished by specifying execution mode SparkStreamingMode. Under the hood it uses "Spark Structured Streaming".
In streaming mode this an Action with SparkStreamingMode is an asynchronous action. Its rhythm can be configured by setting triggerType and triggerTime. 
If not in streaming mode SparkStreamingMode triggers a single microbatch by using triggerType=Once and is fully synchronized. Synchronous execution can be forced for streaming mode as well by explicitly setting triggerType=Once.
"Spark Structured Streaming" is keeping state information about processed data. It needs a checkpointLocation configured which can be given as parameter to SparkStreamingMode.

Note that "Spark Structured Streaming" needs an input DataObject supporting the creation of streaming DataFrames. 
For the time being, only the input sources delivered with Spark Streaming are supported. 
This are KafkaTopicDataObject and all SparkFileDataObjects, see also [Spark StructuredStreaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#creating-streaming-dataframes-and-streaming-datasets).

### SparkIncrementalMode: Incremental Load
As not every input DataObject supports the creation of streaming DataFrames, there is an other execution mode called SparkIncrementalMode.
You configure it by defining the attribute **compareCol** with a column name present in input and output DataObject. 
SparkIncrementalMode then compares the maximum values between input and output and creates a filter condition.
On execution the filter condition is applied to the input DataObject to load the missing increment.
Note that compareCol needs to have a sortable datatype.

By defining **applyCondition** attribute you can give a condition to decide at runtime if the SparkIncrementalMode should be applied or not.
Default is to apply the SparkIncrementalMode. Define an applyCondition by a spark sql expression working with attributes of DefaultExecutionModeExpressionData returning a boolean.

By defining **alternativeOutputId** attribute you can define another DataObject which will be used to check for already existing data.
This can be used to select data to process against a DataObject later in the pipeline.

### FailIfNoPartitionValuesMode
To simply check if partition values are present and fail otherwise, configure execution mode FailIfNoPartitionValuesMode.
This is useful to prevent potential reprocessing of whole table through wrong usage.

### ProcessAllMode
An execution mode which forces processing all data from it's inputs, removing partitionValues and filter conditions received from previous actions.

### CustomPartitionMode
An execution mode to create custom partition execution mode logic in scala. 
Implement trait CustomPartitionModeLogic by defining a function which receives main input&output DataObject and returns partition values to process as Seq[Map[String,String]\]

## Execution Condition
For every Action an executionCondition can be defined. The execution condition allows to define if an action is executed or skipped. The default behaviour is that an Action is skipped if at least one input SubFeed is skipped.
Define an executionCondition by a spark sql expression working with attributes of SubFeedsExpressionData returning a boolean.
The Action is skipped if the executionCondition is evaluated to false. In that case dependent actions get empty SubFeeds marked with isSkipped=true as input.

Example - skip Action only if input1 and input2 SubFeed are skipped: 
```
  executionCondition = "!inputSubFeeds.input1.isSkipped or !inputSubFeeds.input2.isSkipped"
```

Example - Always execute Action and use all existing data as input: 
```
  executionCondition = true
  executionMode = ProcessAllMode
```

## Metrics
Metrics are gathered per Action and output-DataObject when running a DAG. They can be found in log statements and are written to the state file.

Sample log message:
`2020-07-21 11:36:34 INFO  CopyAction:105 - (Action~a) finished writing DataFrame to DataObject~tgt1: duration=PT0.906S records_written=1 bytes_written=1142 num_tasks=1 stage=save`

A fail condition can be specified on Actions to fail execution if a certain condition is not met.
The condition must be specified as spark sql expression, which is evaluated as where-clause against a dataframe of metrics. Available columns are dataObjectId, key, value. 
To fail above sample log in case there are no records written, specify `"dataObjectId = 'tgt1' and key = 'records_written' and value = 0"`.

By implementing interface StateListener  you can get notified about action results & metrics. To configure state listeners set config attribute `global.stateListeners = [{className = ...}]`.

## Spark Transformations
To implement custom transformation logic, define the **transformers** attribute of an Action. It allows you to chain several transformation in a linear process, 
where output SubFeeds from one transformation are use as input for the next.  
Note that the definition of the transformations looks different for:
* **1-to-1** transformations (\*DfTransformer): One input DataFrame is transformed into one output DataFrame. This is the case for CopyAction, DeduplicateAction and HistorizeAction. 
* **many-to-many** transformations (\*DfsTransformer): Many input DataFrames can be transformed into many output DataFrames. This is the case for CustomDataFrameAction.

The configuration allows you to use predefined standard transformations or to define custom transformation in various languages.

**Deprecation Warning**: there has been a refactoring of transformations in Version 2.0.5. The attribute **transformer** is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Use **transformers** instead.

### Predefined Transformations
Predefined transformations implement generic logic to be reused in different actions. The following Transformers exist:
* FilterTransformer (1-to-1): Filter DataFrame with expression
* BlacklistTransformer (1-to-1): Apply a column blacklist to a DataFrame
* WhitelistTransformer (1-to-1): Apply a column whitelist to a DataFrame
* AdditionalColumnsTransformer (1-to-1): Add additional columns to the DataFrame by extracting information from the context
* StandardizeSparkDatatypesTransformer (1-to-1): Standardize datatypes of a Spark-DataFrame
* DfTransformerWrapperDfsTransformer (many-to-many): use 1-to-1 transformer as many-to-many transformer by specifying the SubFeeds it should be applied to

### Custom Transformations
Custom transformers provide an easy way to define your own spark logic in various languages. 

You can pass static **options** and **runtimeOptions** to custom transformations. runtimeOptions are extracted at runtime from the context.
Specifying options allows to reuse a transformation in different settings. 
 
#### Java/Scala
You can use Spark DataFrame API in Java/Scala to define custom transformations. 
If you have a Java project, create a class that extends CustomDfTransformer or CustomDfsTransformer and implement `transform` method.
Then use **type = ScalaClassSparkDfTransformer** or **type = ScalaClassSparkDfsTransformer** and configure **className** attribute.

If you work without Java project, it's still possible to define your transformation in Java/Scala and compile it at runtime.
For a 1-to-1 transformation use **type = ScalaCodeSparkDfTransformer** and configure **code** or **file** as a function that takes `session: SparkSession, options: Map[String,String], df: DataFrame, dataObjectName: String` as parameters and returns a `DataFrame`.
For many-to-many transformations use **type = ScalaCodeSparkDfsTransformer** and configure **code** or **file** as a function that takes `session: SparkSession, options: Map[String,String], dfs: Map[String,DataFrame]` with DataFrames per input DataObject as parameter, and returns a `Map[String,DataFrame]` with the DataFrame per output DataObject.

See [sdl-examples](https://github.com/smart-data-lake/sdl-examples) for details.

#### SQL
You can use Spark SQL to define custom transformations.
Input dataObjects are available as tables to select from. Use tokens %{<key>} to replace with runtimeOptions in SQL code.
For a 1-to-1 transformation use **type = SQLDfTransformer** and configure **code** as your SQL transformation statement.
For many-to-many transformations use **type = SQLDfsTransformer** and configure **code** as a Map of "<outputDataObjectId>, <SQL transformation statement>".

Example - using options in sql code for 1-to-1 transformation:
```
transformers = [{
  type = SQLDfTransformer
  name = "test run"
  description = "description of test run..."
  sqlCode = "select id, cnt, '%{test}' as test, %{run_id} as last_run_id from dataObject1"
  options = {
    test = "test run"
  }
  runtimeOptions = {
    last_run_id = "runId - 1" // runtime options are evaluated as spark SQL expressions against DefaultExpressionData
  }
}]
```

Example - defining a many-to-many transformation:
```
transformers = [{
  type = SQLDfsTransformer
  code = {
    dataObjectOut1 = "select id,cnt from dataObjectIn1 where group = 'test1'",
    dataObjectOut2 = "select id,cnt from dataObjectIn1 where group = 'test2'"
  }
}
```

See [sdl-examples](https://github.com/smart-data-lake/sdl-examples) for details.

#### Python
It's also possible to use Python to define a custom Spark transformation.
For a 1-to-1 transformation use **type = PythonCodeDfTransformer** and configure **code** or **file** as a python function.
PySpark session is initialize and available under variables `sc`, `session`, `sqlContext`.
Other variables available are
* `inputDf`: Input DataFrame
* `options`: Transformation options as Map[String,String]
* `dataObjectId`: Id of input dataObject as String

Output DataFrame must be set with `setOutputDf(df)`.

For now using Python for many-to-many transformations is not possible, although it would be not so hard to implement.

Example - apply some python calculation as udf:
```
transformers = [{
  type = PythonCodeDfTransformer 
  code = """
    |from pyspark.sql.functions import *
    |udf_multiply = udf(lambda x, y: x * y, "int")
    |dfResult = inputDf.select(col("name"), col("cnt"))\
    |  .withColumn("test", udf_multiply(col("cnt").cast("int"), lit(2)))
    |setOutputDf(dfResult)
  """
}]
```

Requirements: 
* Spark 2.4.x: 
  * Python version >= 3.4 an <= 3.7
  * PySpark package matching your spark version
* Spark 3.x:
  * Python version >= 3.4
  * PySpark package matching your spark version

See Readme of [sdl-examples](https://github.com/smart-data-lake/sdl-examples) for a working example and instructions to setup python environment for IntelliJ  

How it works: under the hood a PySpark DataFrame is a proxy for a Java Spark DataFrame. PySpark uses Py4j to access Java objects in the JVM.

## Schema Evolution
SmartDataLakeBuilder is built to support schema evolution where possible. This means that data pipelines adapt themselves automatically to additional or removed columns and changes of data types if possible.
The following cases can be distinguished:
* Overwrite all (CopyAction): if all data of a DataObject is overwritten, the schema can be replaced: additional columns are added, removed columns are removed and data types are changed. Requirements: 
  * Output DataObject needs to be able to replace schema.
* Overwrite all keeping existing data (Historize- & DeduplicateAction): Action consolidates new data with existing data. The schema needs to be evolved: additional columns are added with null value for existing records, removed columns are kept with null values for new records and data types are changed to new data type if supported. Requirements: 
  * Output DataObject needs to be able to replace schema.
  * Output DataObject must be a TransactionalSparkTableDataObject (read existing data and overwrite new data in the same SparkJob, preventing data loss in case of errors).
* Overwrite incremental using merge (CopyAction, DeduplicateAction): Action incrementally merges new data into existing data. The schema needs to be evolved: additional columns are added with null value for existing records, removed columns are kept with null values for new records and data types are changed to new data type if supported. Requirements:
  * Output DataObject needs to support CanEvolveSchema (alter schema automatically when writing to this DataObject with different schema)
  * Output DataObject needs to support CanMergeDataFrame (use SQL merge statement to update and insert records transactionally)

To assert that a defined list of columns is always present in the schema of a specific DataObject, use its `schemaMin` attribute to define a minimal schema. The minimal schema is validated on read and write with Spark.

To fix the schema for a specific DataObject many DataObjects support the `schema` attribute (e.g. all children of SparkFileDataObject) for reading and writing with Spark. 
The `schema` attribute allows to define the schema the DataObject tries to read data with, and can be used to avoid schema inference with Spark DataSources.
On write the DataFrame to be written must match the defined `schema` exactly (nullability and column order are ignored). 

The following list describes specific behaviour of DataObjects:
* HiveTableDataObject & TickTockHiveTableDataObject: Table schema is managed by Hive and automatically created on first write and updated on subsequent overwrites of the whole table. Changing schema for partitioned tables is not supported.
  By manipulating the table definition with DDL statements (e.g. alter table add columns) its possible to read data files with a different schema. 
* SparkFileDataObject: see detailed description in [Spark Data Sources](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources.html).
  * Many Data Sources support schema inference (e.g. Json, Csv), but we would not recommend this for production data pipelines as the result might not be stable when new data arrives.
  * For Data Formats with included schema (e.g. Avro, Parquet), schema is read from a random data file. If data files have different schemas, Parquet Data Source supports to consolidate schemas by setting option `mergeSchema=true`. Avro Data Source does not support this.
  * If you define the `schema` attribute of the DataObject, SDL tries to read the data files with the defined schema. This is e.g. supported by the Json Data Source, but not the CSV Data Source.
* JdbcTableDataObject: The database table can be created automatically on first write or by providing a create table statement in `createSql` attribute. Also existing table is automatically adapted (add & change column) when option `allowSchemaEvolution=true`. 
* DeltaLakeTableDataObject: Existing schema is automatically adapted (add & change column) when option `allowSchemaEvolution=true`.

Recipes for data pipelines with schema evolution:
* "Overwrite all" with CopyAction: overwriting the whole output DataObject including its schema. It needs an output DataObject which doesn't have a fixed schema, e.g. HiveTableDataObject.
* "Overwrite all keeping existing data" with HistorizeAction & DeduplicateAction: consolidate the existing data & schema of the output DataObject with a potentially new schema of the input DataObject. Then it overwrites the whole output DataObject. It needs a TransactionalSparkTableDataObject as output, e.g. TickTockHiveTableDataObject.
* "Overwrite incremental using merge" with CopyAction & DeduplicateAction: evolve the existing schema of the output DataObject and insert and update new data using merge. It needs an output DataObject supporting CanMergeDataFrame and CanEvolveSchema, e.g. JdbcTableDataObject, DeltaLakeTableObject

## Housekeeping
SmartDataLakeBuilder supports housekeeping for DataObjects by specifying the HousekeepingMode.

The following HousekeepingModes are currently implemented:
* PartitionRetentionMode: Define partitions to keep by configuring a retentionCondition. 
  retentionCondition is a spark sql expression working with the attributes of PartitionExpressionData returning a boolean with value true if the partition should be kept.
* PartitionArchiveCompactionMode: Archive and compact old partitions.
  * Archive partition reduces the number of partitions in the past by moving older partitions into special "archive partitions". 
    archiveCondition defines a spark sql expression working with the attributes of PartitionExpressionData returning archive partition values as Map\[String,String\].
    If return value is the same as input partition values, the partition is not touched. Otherwise all files of the partition are moved to the corresponding partition. 
    Be aware that the value of the partition columns changes for these files/records.
  * Compact partition reduces the number of files in a partition by rewriting them with Spark.
    compactPartitionExpression defines a sql expression working with the attributes of PartitionExpressionData returning true if this partition should be compacted.
    Once a partition is compacted, it is marked as compacted and will not be compacted again. It is therefore ok to return true for all partitions which should be compacted, regardless if they have been compacted already.

Example - cleanup partitions with partition layout dt=<yyyymmdd> after 90 days:
```
housekeepingMode = {
  type = PartitionRetentionMode
  retentionCondition = "datediff(now(), to_date(elements['dt'], 'yyyyMMdd')) <= 90"
}
```
