## User Interface
In the Schema Viewer, the user interface is comprised of three main elements, each serving a distinct purpose to enhance your experience and efficiency.

1. **Top Bar**: The Schema Viewer's top bar hosts a crucial featureâ€”the schema version selection dropdown. This feature allows you to effortlessly switch between different versions of the displayed API schema. The search bar is another powerful functionality. It simplifies the process of locating specific elements or relationships within your schema. It's a time-saving tool that helps you pinpoint the exact data you're looking for. Finally, for those who need to work with the schema data in a more flexible format, the 'Download' button, also found in the top bar, is really helpful. With a single click, you can obtain the schema in JSON format, making it easy to read it in a Scala or Python script.
2. **Action Bar**: The Action Bar provides user-friendly zoom controls, allowing you to zoom in for a closer examination of schema details or zoom out for a broader overview. There are times when you might navigate the schema in great detail, and the 'Reset' button in the Action Bar acts as your convenient escape hatch. It ensures that, with a simple click, you can easily return to the default view, helping you regain your bearings when necessary. In the Action Bar, you'll also find a schema elements legend. This handy reference guide deciphers the various icons and colors used to represent schema elements.
3. **Schema Browser**: Here, you'll encounter a visual representation of the API schema you're working with. This central hub brings the schema to life, presenting it in a structured and intuitive manner.
