Smart Data Lake Builder is built to run anywhere.
It can be run as java application using e.g. spark-submit or in a container, as shown in [Getting Started](../getting-started/setup.md).

It can be run locally, on your server or in a large cluster to leverage the resources of your on-premise or cloud infrastructure.

So far, we have successfully used Smart Data Lake Builder on Microsoft Azure, Google DataProc, AWS Databricks and YARN.
The following subpages help you to get started in these different environments.

<!-- TODO double check the other provisioning methods and activate them -->
<!-- - [Deploy on Google DataProc](deploy-google-dataproc.md)-->
