/**
 *  [[Agent]] that communicates via a Azure Relay Service.
 * See the class SmartDataLakeBuilderAzureRelayAgentIT for an example.
 *
 * @param url         Connection URL on how the agent can be reached. See io.smartdatalake.app.SmartDataLakeBuilderAzureRelayAgentIT#azureRelayUrl for an example.
 * @param connections : Map of private connections that this agent has access to.
 *                    Connections defined in the agents section override connections defined in the global connections section when they are executed on the Agent.
 *                    This allows the Agent to use some connections that are only accessible in the Agent's environment and not on the Remote Instance.
 *                    When the Agent is deployed, it gets the necessary authentication information for these agent connections on startup and then just waits for instructions.
